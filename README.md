# Tableau-Visualization-NewYork-Flight-Delays

## About this project
Welcome to my Tableau dashboards which visualizes NYC flight delay patterns in 2013 by differrent dimensions. These dashboards are designed as a practical tool to help users better predict flight departure and arrival delays: users are able to easily interact with the dashboards and vsiualize the average delay time by selecting various parameters, such as their arrival and departure locations, flight times, airlines, and airplane manufacturers.

## Preview of my dashboards
In designing these visualizations, I leveraged my creativity to craft an aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, and diverse tool, with a goal of optimizing user experience and efficiency. The dashboards feature a variety of plot types, including maps, bar plots, and line graphs, each chosen to best represent the underlying data and insights. 

### Delay by geography and carriers:

**Upper Left Map**

The map provides a visual representation of air routes to and from New York City across the United States. It uniquely illustrates the average delay percentages by destination using bubble sizes. Larger bubbles signify a higher average delay percentage at a particular location. Additionally, the color coding offers an immediate understanding of the average delay times: red indicates longer delays, while blue represents shorter ones. This intuitive design allows users to quickly grasp the delay patterns and frequencies associated with different destinations

**Left Lower Bar Plot**
This bar plot compares the average lengths of arrival and departure delays across different carriers. The color gradient of each barin dicates the total number of flights for each carrier. This representation allows for a comprehensive understanding of delay patterns in relation to carrier flight volume.

**Right Bar Plot**
Adjacent to this, the bar plot on the right side focuses on average delay times categorized by state. This visualization offers a clear geographical perspective, allowing users to identify which states are more prone to delays. By comparing delay times across states, users can gain insights into regional variations in flight punctuality.
