# Tableau-Visualization-NewYork-Flight-Delays

## About this project
Welcome to my Tableau dashboards which visualizes NYC flight delay patterns in 2013 by differrent dimensions. These dashboards are designed as a practical tool to help users better predict flight departure and arrival delays: users are able to easily interact with the dashboards and vsiualize the average delay time by selecting various parameters, such as their arrival and departure locations, flight times, airlines, and airplane manufacturers.

## Preview of my dashboards
In designing these visualizations, I leveraged my creativity to craft an aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, and diverse tool, with a goal of optimizing user experience and efficiency. The dashboards feature a variety of plot types, including maps, bar plots, and line graphs, each chosen to best represent the underlying data and insights.
